<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>For the Chicken:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 small boneless skinless chicken breasts, about 12 ounces (340g) total, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons (10ml) light soy sauce</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons (about 5g) cornstarch</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon (5 ml) Shaoxing wine</li>
    <li>1 large pinch kosher salt</li>
</ul>

<h3>For the Sauce:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) Chinkiang vinegar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon (15ml) honey</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon (15ml) Shaoxing wine</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons (10ml) light soy sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon (about 2g) cornstarch</li>
    <li>1/4 cup water or homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock, as needed</li>
</ul>

<h3>For the Stir-Fry:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3 tablespoons (45ml) vegetable oil</li>
    <li>6 to 12 small dried red chiles (such as &aacute;rbol), stems removed, cut into 1/2-inch pieces with scissors, seeds discarded</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon (about 2g) Sichuan peppercorns, reddish husks only (stems and black seeds discarded)</li>
    <li>4 medium cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>1-inch knob ginger, peeled and cut into fine matchsticks or grated</li>
    <li>6 medium scallions, white and pale green parts only, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
    <li>3/4 cup roasted peanuts (about 5 ounces; 150g)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>For the Chicken:</strong> Combine chicken, soy sauce, cornstarch, wine, and salt in a small bowl and turn until well mixed and chicken is evenly coated in a thin film of the cornstarch paste. Set aside.</li>
    <li><strong>For the Sauce:</strong> Combine vinegar, honey, wine, soy sauce, and cornstarch in a small bowl. Stir together with a fork until no clumps of cornstarch remain.</li>
    <li><strong>To Stir-Fry:</strong> Pour a small amount of oil into the bottom of a large wok or skillet and rub around with a paper towel. Place over high heat and preheat until smoking. Add remaining oil and immediately add chiles and Sichuan peppercorns. Stir-fry until fragrant but not burnt, about 5 seconds. Immediately add chicken and stir-fry until there are no longer pink spots on the exterior (chicken will still be raw in center at this stage), 45 seconds to 1 1/2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add garlic and ginger and stir-fry until fragrant, about 10 seconds. Add scallions and peanuts and stir-fry for 30 seconds.</li>
    <li>Add sauce and stir-fry until all the ingredients are coated evenly and the chicken is cooked through, about 1 minute, adding water 1 tablespoon at a time if necessary to keep the sauce from clumping. Serve immediately with steamed white rice.</li>
