<h2>Description</h2>

This is one of my favourite weeknight meals, comforting and nourishing!  Recipe content (including header image) is copied directly from <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/oyakodon-japanese-chicken-and-egg-rice-bowl-recipe">Serious Eats website</a>, and was originally written by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JKenjiLopezAlt">J. Kenji Lopez-Alt</a>.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup (240ml) homemade or instant dashi</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) dry sake</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon (15ml) soy sauce, plus more to taste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon (15g) sugar, plus more to taste</li>
    <li>1 large onion (about 6 ounces; 170g), thinly sliced</li>
    <li>12 ounces (340g) boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breast, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>3 scallions, ends trimmed and thinly sliced, divided</li>
    <li>2 stems mitsuba (optional)</li>
    <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
</ul>

<h3>To Serve:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups cooked white rice</li>
    <li>Togarashi</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Combine dashi, sake, soy sauce, and sugar in a 10-inch skillet and bring to a simmer over high heat. Adjust heat to maintain a strong simmer. Stir in onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is half tender, about 5 minutes. Add chicken pieces and cook, stirring and turning chicken occasionally, until chicken is cooked through and broth has reduced by about half, 5 to 7 minutes for chicken thighs or 3 to 4 minutes for chicken breast. Stir in half of scallions and all of mitsuba (if using), then season broth to taste with more soy sauce or sugar as desired. The sauce should have a balanced sweet-and-salty flavor.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat to a bare simmer. Pour beaten eggs into skillet in a thin, steady stream, holding chopsticks over edge of bowl to help distribute eggs evenly. Cover and cook until eggs are cooked to desired doneness, about 1 minute for runny eggs or 3 minutes for medium-firm.</li>
    <li><strong>To Serve:</strong> Transfer hot rice to a single large bowl or 2 individual serving bowls. Top with egg and chicken mixture, pouring out any excess broth from saucepan over rice. Add an extra egg yolk to center of each bowl, if desired. Garnish with remaining sliced scallions and togarashi. Serve immediately.</li>
